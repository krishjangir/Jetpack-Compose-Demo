Jetpack-Compose-Demo: An Open Source Android App Built with Modern Technologies
Jetpack-Compose-Demo is an open-source Android application that showcases the use of Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs. The app is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of Jetpack Compose and how it can be used to create beautiful, responsive, and interactive user interfaces.

Components:
Jetpack-Compose-Demo features a variety of Jetpack Compose components, including:
* AlertDialog: A dialog window that prompts the user for a response.
* BottomAppBar: A bottom app bar that displays navigation and action items.
* Dialog: A modal dialog window that displays content to the user.
* ProgressIndicator: A circular progress indicator that shows the progress of a task.
* TopAppBar: A top app bar that displays the app's title, navigation, and action items.
* ModalNavigationDrawer: A navigation drawer that slides in from the side of the screen.
* Card: A card that displays content and can be interacted with.
* ShimmerEffect: An effect that animates a placeholder UI until the content is loaded.
* ExoPlayer: A media player for playing video and audio content.
* VideoPlayer: A video player for playing video content.
* ViewPager: A horizontal paging container that displays content in pages.
* HorizontalPager: A horizontal paging container that displays content in a carousel-like fashion.
* LazyRow: A horizontal layout container that lazily loads its content.
* LazyColumn: A vertical layout container that lazily loads its content.
* Animation: An animation library that allows for the creation of complex animations.
* Navigation: A navigation library that provides a way to navigate between different screens.
* Material 3: A design language that emphasizes the use of bold typography, vibrant colors, and layered elements.
* Camera: A library that provides access to the device's camera and allows for the capture of photos and videos.
* Paging3: A library that provides pagination support for large data sets.

Architecture:
Jetpack-Compose-Demo follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which separates the UI logic from the business logic. The model represents the data, the view represents the UI, and the view model acts as an intermediary between the two. This pattern allows for better separation of concerns and easier unit testing.

Dependency Injection:
Jetpack-Compose-Demo uses Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection. Dagger-Hilt is a lightweight dependency injection library that simplifies the process of dependency injection in Android apps. It allows for easy creation and management of objects and their dependencies.

Unit Testing:
Jetpack-Compose-Demo uses JUnit and Mockito for unit testing. JUnit is a unit testing framework that provides a way to write tests for individual components of the app. Mockito is a mocking library that allows for the creation of mock objects for testing.

Third-party Libraries:
Jetpack-Compose-Demo uses Glide for image loading and caching. Glide is a fast and efficient image loading library that provides caching, resizing, and transformation capabilities. It also integrates with popular image formats like GIFs and WebP.

The project showcases how to build a simple app that fetches data from a RESTful API using Retrofit and displays it using Jetpack Compose. The app displays a list of images fetched from the API using Glide for efficient image loading.
The project provides a simple implementation of a network API call using Retrofit. The API service is defined in a separate file, and the app uses the Retrofit client to make a request to the API. The response from the API is then parsed into a list of image objects using a Gson converter.
